# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company planning to launch an online video rental service. 

**Objective** My task was to help with the launch strategy by using SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions, then present the results of your analysis to Rockbuster management.

**Dataset** Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, and payments. A data dictionary is included in files.
